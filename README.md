# MVC

Alessio: 
Here is the project for the IS exercise about the MVC.
I already started developing the model, creating a WebPage class with the main functions of the application.
I also implemented the observer design pattern to allow an active communication with the view, who will need to register as an observer.
Moreover, I started creating the classes for the controller and the view, but you're free to implement them as you want.
Ask me for whatever change you'd like to apply or suggestion you have about the model.
Have fun!
